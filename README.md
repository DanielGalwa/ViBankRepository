This application is a secure online banking platform that allows users to manage their accounts and perform transactions. It provides a well-structured interface for viewing account balances, reviewing transaction histories, and processing fund transfers. Additionally, the system integrates two-factor authentication and multiple security mechanisms—such as Content Security Policies, CSRF tokens, HttpOnly cookies with the SameSite=Strict attribute, password brute-force prevention, and input sanitization—to protect user data from unauthorized access.
